# LIRIBOT-UCB
A Command-Line Program

You know Siri? Well this is better, it's Liri! It does a fraction of the functions in a similar amount of time!

Use LIRIBOT functions to:
*spotify-this-song* - Return data about a song.
*movie* - Get info from IMDB about a movie.
*my-tweets* - See tweets from your favorite Github user (me).
